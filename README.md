This Project will help analyze an HR dataset with the objective of solving a classification problem focused on employee attrition prediction. 
The problem is quite common in HR, where the factors leading to employee attrition are understood in terms of helping businesses design better retention strategies,
improve workplace satisfaction, and reduce turnover costs. The dataset contains all demographics, job role, education, and work-related attributes of employees, 
including monthly income, overtime status, and performance metrics, 
to find a pattern that will predict whether an employee will leave the company.
